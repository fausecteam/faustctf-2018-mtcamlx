# MtCamlX

## System overview

MtCamlX is a Secure Crypto(tm) trading platform. It leverages the
security of typesafe languages, provable security and a microservice
architecture to deliver the well deserved security we all hope for
when trading our Crypto(tm).

## Trading view

Our intuitive trading interface uses Haskell's Brick library to
benefit from reactive user interface design and improved security of a
typesafe language. We publish our source code for increased confidence
in the functionality of MtCamlX.

## The message backend

The message backend allows traders to securely communicate as well as
to offer transactions on the marketplace for direct exchange. Like all
the backends it is written in a modern, type-safe language (OCaml) and
is therefore secure. Our well-written source code is available for
your inspection!

## The trading backend

Our patented trading backend makes sure you always get the best rates
when trading your Crypto(tm). State-of-the art technology make sure
our platform is always liquid and can sell you arbitrary amounts of
any Crypto(tm) you want to buy.

Unfortunately the trading backend is so groundbreaking we have to
protect the source due to business interests. But be assured, the same
code quality and typesafe languages were used when creating it and it
is therefore just as secure as the rest of MtCamlX.

## The authentication backend

Our authentication backend uses provably secure cryptography which
allows to retain full security even in the event of a partial
compromise of the system.

For even greater performance we will soon upgrade our implementation
to a newer system, so stay tuned!
